# Introduction

A repository for hosting coding challenges.

## Phase I

Please fork our repository to your personal Github account.

## Phase II

There are two images that are identical, though they are identified to the DOM with separate ids.

1. What is the difference between these two images?
2. What are the implications for how these images load?
3. What can be done to make these images load correctly with a version number?

## Phase II

This page makes a good candidate for using the Bootstrap framework.  Please do the following:

1. Load the Bootstrap framework
2. Theme the page using Bootstrap following this <a href="design-guide.png">visual design guide</a>
3. Ensure the page renders "responsively", for Desktop and Mobile

## Phase III

1. Using the inline CSS, make a slideshow out of the images.
2. Does where you load the CSS matter?  Please explain.
3. Make it possible to allow a user to "Like" or "Thumbs-up" an image in the slideshow?  This does not require integrating with any third-party services like Facebook and does not need to be saved into a database.

## Phase IV

Observer employs lots of experiments to measure how users interact with page elements.

Conceive of an experiment that you would like to run on this page.  You should conceive of only 1 test.

Using Javascript, demonstrate the ability to do the following:

1. On page load, randomly decide what test group a user will be assigned to -- Users should be assigned to a "Control" group or the "Variation" group.
2. Based on this value, render the page appropriately for the test.

## Phase V

Please notice there's a form near the bottom of the page where users are invited to enter an email address and submit it.  In other words, users are being asked to sign up for something!)

1. Use Javascript to validate that a user types in an email address
2. Use Javascript to prevent users from submitting their email address more than once
3. Use Javascript to display feedback to the user (ie: Thanks for signing up!).  Once a user has signed up, consider hiding the form so that users don't sign up again.

# Conclusion

Once you've completed the Phases, please push to your repository.  Add a file answers.txt that provides the written responses to any questions above.

Deploy your results to Github Pages and let's review it together!
